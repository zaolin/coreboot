- 1.1.0
Intial development release of LinuxBIOS.
Everything is thrown overboard and will be reincluded as necessary so we can
get rid of the legacy baggage.  Since LinuxBIOS was started we have developed
some better techniques for some things, but we still hang on to the old ways
because some ports that we want not to break depend on them.  So we preserve
them by preserve the 1.0.x series and keeping only the best practices for
the 1.1.x series.  When there is a stable port this code base will
become LinuxBIOS 2.0.x and the core will become frozen.
