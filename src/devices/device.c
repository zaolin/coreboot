/* Compute allocate resources is the guts of the resource allocator.
 * 
 * The problem.
 *  - Allocate resources locations for every device.
 *  - Don't overlap, and follow the rules of bridges.
 *  - Don't overlap with resources in fixed locations.
 *  - Be efficient so we don't have ugly strategies.
 *
 * The strategy.
 * - Devices that have fixed addresses are the minority so don't
 *   worry about them too much.  Instead only use part of the address
 *   space for devices with programmable addresses.  This easily handles
 *   everything except bridges.
 *
 * - PCI devices are required to have thier sizes and their alignments
 *   equal.  In this case an optimal solution to the packing problem
 *   exists.  Allocate all devices from highest alignment to least
 *   alignment or vice versa.  Use this.
 *
 * - So we can handle more than PCI run two allocation passes on
 *   bridges.  The first to see how large the resources are behind
 *   the bridge, and what their alignment requirements are.  The
 *   second to assign a safe address to the devices behind the
 *   bridge.  This allows me to treat a bridge as just a device with 
 *   a couple of resources, and not need to special case it in the
 *   allocator.  Also this allows handling of other types of bridges.
