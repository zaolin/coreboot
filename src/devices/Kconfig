config VGA_BRIDGE_SETUP
	bool "Setup bridges on path to VGA adapter"
	default y
	help
	  Allow bridges to set up legacy decoding ranges for VGA. Don't disable
	  this unless you're sure you don't want the briges setup for VGA.

# TODO: Explain differences (if any) for onboard cards.
config VGA_ROM_RUN
	bool "Run VGA option ROMs"
	default y
	help
	  Execute VGA option ROMs, if found. This is required to enable
	  PCI/AGP/PCI-E video cards.

config PCI_ROM_RUN
	bool "Run non-VGA option ROMs"
	default y
	help
	  Execute non-VGA PCI option ROMs, if found.

	  Examples include IDE/SATA controller option ROMs and option ROMs
	  for network cards (NICs).

config PCI_OPTION_ROM_RUN_REALMODE
	prompt "Native mode"
	bool
	depends on ARCH_X86
	help
	  If you select this option, PCI option ROMs will be executed
	  natively on the CPU in real mode. No CPU emulation is involved,
	  so this is the fastest, but also the least secure option.
	  (only works on x86/x64 systems)

config PCI_OPTION_ROM_RUN_YABEL
	prompt "Secure Mode"
	bool
	help
	  If you select this option, the x86emu CPU emulator will be used to
	  execute PCI option ROMs.
	  This option prevents option ROMs from doing dirty tricks with the 
	  system (such as installing SMM modules or hypervisors), but it is also
	  significantly slower than the native option ROM initialization method.
	  This is the default choice for non-x86 systems.

config YABEL_PCI_ACCESS_OTHER_DEVICES
	prompt "Allow option roms to acces other devices"
	bool
	depends on PCI_OPTION_ROM_RUN_YABEL
	help
	  Per default, YABEL only allows option roms to access the PCI device
	  that they are associated with. However, this causes trouble for some
	  onboard graphics chips whose option rom needs to reconfigure the 
	  north bridge. 

config YABEL_VIRTMEM_LOCATION
	prompt "Location of YABEL's virtual memory"
	hex
	depends on PCI_OPTION_ROM_RUN_YABEL && EXPERT
	default 0x1000000
	help
	  YABEL requires 1MB memory for its CPU emulation. This memory is
	  normally located at 16MB.

config YABEL_DIRECTHW
	prompt "Direct Hardware Access"
	bool
	depends on PCI_OPTION_ROM_RUN_YABEL
	help
	  YABEL consists of two parts: It uses x86emu for the CPU emulation and
	  additionally provides a PC system emulation that filters bad device and
	  memory access (such as PCI config space access to other devices than the
	  initialized one).
	  When choosing this option, x86emu will pass through all hardware
	  accesses to memory and IO devices to the underlying memory and IO
	  addresses. While this option prevents option ROMs from doing dirty
	  tricks with the CPU (such as installing SMM modules or hypervisors),
	  they can still access all devices in the system.
	  Enable this option for a good compromise between security and speed.

config BOOTSPLASH
	prompt "Show graphical bootsplash"
	bool
	depends on PCI_OPTION_ROM_RUN_YABEL
	help
	  This option shows a graphical bootsplash screen. The grapics are
	  loaded from the CBFS file bootsplash.jpg

config FRAMEBUFFER_VESA_MODE
	prompt "VESA framebuffer video mode"
	hex
	default 0x117
	depends on BOOTSPLASH
	help
	  This option sets the resolution used for the coreboot framebuffer and
	  bootsplash screen. Set to 0x117 for 1024x768x16. A diligent soul will 
	  some day make this a "choice".

config COREBOOT_KEEP_FRAMEBUFFER
	prompt "Keep VESA framebuffer"
	bool
	depends on BOOTSPLASH
	help
	  This option keeps the framebuffer mode set after coreboot finishes
	  execution. If this option is enabled, coreboot will pass a framebuffer
	  entry in its coreboot table and the payload will need a framebuffer
	  driver. If this option is disabled, coreboot will switch back to 
	  text mode before handing control to a payload.
