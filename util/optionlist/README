I would like to contribute the following to the coreboot wiki in case
it's useable:

1. I have written a rather small Python script to convert the Options.lb
   into an XML file which is much more useable for the web in most cases.

2. I have written a XSLT to convert the XML file to (X)HTML to be able
   to present it as a table.
