I would like to contribute the following to the LinuxBIOS wiki in case
it's useable:

1. I have written a rather small python script to convert the Options.lb
   to a XML file which is much more useable for the web in most cases.

2. I have written a XSLT to convert the XML file to (X)HTML to be able
   to present it as a table.
