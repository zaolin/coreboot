Legacy bios emulation
---------------------

goal of this software is to initialize pci devices with legacy x86 
option roms with no regard to the underlying platform. Use legacybios
as an ELF payload to LinuxBIOS/etherboot.

Currently this is really hackish and it does not work, but it's on the way.

Using a trampoline, this code could be shrinked to be really small 
on the x86 platform, since no cpu emulation is needed. 
Currently all platforms use x86emu for testing.
