Most of the analysis, design and implementation of the project was done by
me, Adam Sulmicki. I have received invaluable help from Adam Agnew. Bill
Arbaugh was the person who made it all possible.

I also received help from Christophe Bothamy, Bochs' developer, on all
Boch's bios related issues. Thanks!

I also got tips from Eric W. Biederman, as well as other members of the
LinuxBIOS mailing list.
