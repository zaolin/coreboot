Superiotool README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Superiotool is a user-space utility which can

 - detect which Super I/O chip is soldered onto your mainboard,

 - at which configuration port it's located (usually 0x2e or 0x4e), and

 - dump all register contents of the Super I/O chip, together with the
   default values as per datasheet (to make comparing the values easy).

It is mainly used for LinuxBIOS development purposes (see linuxbios.org
for details on LinuxBIOS), but it may also be useful for other things.


Installation
------------

 $ svn co svn://linuxbios.org/repos/trunk/util/superiotool

 $ make

 $ sudo make install


Usage
-----

 $ superiotool

Currently the tool will automatically try to detect which Super I/O you
have, and also dump the register contents.
