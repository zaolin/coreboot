	  The alternate character set (ACS) is used for drawing lines and
	  displaying a couple of other special graphics characters.  The
	  ACS characters generally look good on screen, but can be difficult
	  to cut and paste from a terminal window to a text editor.
	
	  Say 'y' here if you want to always use plain ASCII characters to
	  approximate the appearance of ACS characters on the serial port 
	  console.

config RTC_PORT_EXTENDED_VIA
	bool "Extended RTC ports are 0x74/0x75"

	help
	  For recent chipsets with 256 NVRAM bytes, you have to access the
	  upper 128 bytes (128-255) using two different I/O ports,
	  usually 0x72/0x73.
	
	  On some chipsets this can be a different set of ports, though.
	  The VIA VT8237R for example only recognizes the ports 0x74/0x75
	  for accessing the high 128 NVRAM bytes (as seems to be the case for
	  multiple VIA chipsets).
	
	  If you want to read or write CMOS bytes on computers with one of
	  these chipsets, say 'y' here.
