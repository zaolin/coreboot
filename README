coreboot README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

coreboot is a Free Software project aimed at replacing the proprietary
BIOS you can find in most of today's computers.

It performs just a little bit of hardware initialization and then executes
one of many possible payloads, e.g. a Linux kernel or a bootloader.


Payloads
--------

After the basic initialization of the hardware has been performed, any
desired "payload" can be started by coreboot.

See http://www.coreboot.org/Payloads for a list of supported payloads.


Supported Hardware
------------------

coreboot supports a wide range of chipsets, devices, and mainboards.

For details please consult:

 * http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Motherboards
 * http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Chipsets_and_Devices


Build Requirements
------------------

 * gcc / g++
 * make
 * python
 * perl

Optional:

 * doxygen (for generating/viewing documentation)
 * iasl (for targets with ACPI support)
 * gdb (for better debugging facilities on some targets)
 * ncurses (for 'make menuconfig')


Building coreboot
-----------------

Please consult http://www.coreboot.org/Documentation for details.


Testing coreboot Without Modifying Your Hardware
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to test coreboot without any risks before you really decide
to use it on your hardware, you can use the QEMU system emulator to run
coreboot virtually in QEMU.

Please see http://www.coreboot.org/QEMU for details.


Website and Mailing List
------------------------

Further details on the project, a FAQ, many HOWTOs, news, development
guidelines and more can be found on the coreboot website:
